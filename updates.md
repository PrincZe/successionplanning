# HR Succession Planning System - Codebase Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a Succession Planning Application (called CHRONOS - CHROO's Human Resource Officer Nexus and Organisational Succession Tool) designed for a government organization to manage Human Resources positions across various agencies. The system helps track and manage succession planning for key HR positions, officers' competencies, and their career development.

## Database Structure
The project uses Supabase as its database solution with the following key tables:

1. **officers** - Stores information about HR officers including their ID, name, grade, and certification
2. **positions** - Tracks HR positions across agencies with details like title, agency, grade
3. **position_successors** - Maps positions to potential successors with different time horizons
4. **hr_competencies** - Lists various HR competency areas
5. **officer_competencies** - Tracks proficiency levels of officers in different competencies
6. **ooa_stints** - Records Out-of-Agency stints/attachments available
7. **officer_stints** - Maps which officers completed which stints
8. **officer_remarks** - Stores additional remarks about officers

## Authentication & Authorization
The system originally implemented authentication using Supabase Auth, but has been modified for prototype purposes:

### âœ… Authentication Changes for Prototype
- Authentication has been disabled entirely for easier demonstration
- A mock user is automatically provided through the AuthContext
- The middleware has been simplified to allow all requests without auth checks
- Landing page and login page now automatically redirect to the home dashboard with delays
- No email validation or login process is required

### ðŸ”„ Navigation Loop Fix
- Fixed redirect loop issue by:
  - Removing authentication checks in the home page server component
  - Changing navigation from `router.replace()` to `router.push()`
  - Adding proper delays before navigation (3000ms)
  - Adding state tracking to prevent multiple redirects
  - Using loading indicators to improve user experience during navigation

### ðŸ‘¤ Sign Out Functionality
- Fixed sign out functionality to provide a more realistic experience:
  - Created a dedicated `/signedout` page that shows the landing page without auto-redirect
  - Modified the sign out function in AuthContext to navigate to this page
  - Added visual confirmation of signed out status with a return to dashboard option
  - Preserved the landing page design with additional "signed out" messaging

These changes allow for seamless demonstration of the application without authentication barriers, while preserving the UI components that would normally interact with authenticated user data.

## Key Features Implemented

### Position Management
- Listing all positions across agencies
- Position details view with incumbent information
- Ability to assign/edit immediate and future successors

### Officer Management
- Officer profiles with competency and stint information
- Career progression tracking
- Competency development monitoring

### Competency Framework
- Tracking proficiency levels (PL1-PL5) across HR competencies
- Recording and updating competency assessments

### Stint Tracking
- Recording of Out-of-Agency stints and experiences
- Tracking officers' development through various attachments

## Technical Implementation
- Next.js App Router for routing and server components
- Supabase for database and authentication
- React with Tailwind CSS for UI
- Framer Motion for animations
- Server Actions for data mutations

## Project Structure
- `/src/app` - Main application pages and routes
- `/src/app/positions`, `/src/app/officers`, etc. - Feature-specific routes
- `/src/lib` - Utilities and database connections
- `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware

## Development Status
Most of the core functionality appears to be implemented, including:
- Database schema design and implementation
- ~~Authentication flow~~ (disabled for prototype)
- Position and officer management interfaces
- Competency tracking system
- Succession planning tools

The project appears to be a functional HR succession planning tool with a modern UI and comprehensive features for tracking positions, officers, competencies, and development opportunities across government agencies.
